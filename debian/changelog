  the "I got a flu this weekend" release
  * gtkmorph: fix nasty bug: would crash when saving the resulting  mesh
    (due to double fclose); thanks "kkilfedder at iee dot org" 
  * gtkmorph: debugging of "features":
    - allocate_colors in main() otherwise features are broken
    - due to stupid newline in glade,  the combo was not empty when created!
      this was breaking the feature renaming and such! 
      for the future, feature_init() clears the combo  
    - save features names in meshes, and load them with meshes
    - redraw the color in the button when the feature entry changes
    - properly refresh the color in the colored button when the feature changes
  * gtkmorph: feature names are saved at the end of the meshes
    (example meshes in AD and AD2 contain feature names).
  * gtkmorph: the setting "mesh is readonly" was not working 
  * gtkmorph: does not load the example session if some meshes are unsaved
  * gtkmorph: when "showing warp in other window" is on and 
     "show warp after warp" is off, the warp-showing window was not working
  * morph: do not print warnings

  * new feature: can load, save, and display "difference meshes", that 
    are difference of two meshes; those can be added to a morph, to morph
    in a particular direction
  * more uniform naming scheme for windows and images
  * disabled "view original mesh" and "view original points"
   in main window: there is no difference between "original" and "warped" there!
  * add many "g_return_if_fail(meshAllocated(...))" to protect from bugs
  * can stop movie making
  * create pixmap when displaying a window (an empty window is useless)
  * rerun automake autoconf libtoolize gettextize
  * now "make dist" creates a tar that does compile
    (so some useless stuff deleted from tar in Debian :-)

  * choose strength of wavelet equalization
  * can use keys  0...9 to set point labels, and 'ijkl' to finely move points
    (this was present, but did not work with GTK2)
  * revised libmorph/README.libmorph
  * the GTK1 interface is outdated  wrt what gtkmorph now offers with GTK2 :
    - the code for using wavelets does not work with GTK1 
    - the mplayer button is not there
    - the button for changing feature colors is not there
    - images can only be saved in PPM format
  * in movie making : the role of end and start was inverted !
  * do not update config.guess and config.sub : it breaks compilation
  * when rescaling meshes  (when user changes the resulting image size)
    the mesh border was used and affected (and this is wrong): added
    new function meshScaleFreeformat in libmorph
  * when loading  meshes in a gtkmorph with different resulting size,
    the mesh has wrong size: now resulting image size is saved with the mesh

  * in GTK2 the callback for key presses in the window area was not binded
  * wavelet statistics are computed while warping and not while blending

  * the warp pulls pixel from loaded image and not from the editing subimage,
    and the resample code pads image with its border color and not with black

  * added 'disable-rpath' to configure 
  * the spinbuttons in GTK2 use value-changed callback
  
    (1:20040713) unreleased
  
  * code clean up: divided 'callbacks.c' and 'utils.c' in many files
  * use  'gdk_window_invalidate_rect' instead of 'gtk_widget_draw' in
     GTK2 : the responsiveness of the program is much improved
  * gtk-meta.h and gtk-meta.c to compile for win32 and  gtk 1.2 , 2.2 

    (1:20040707) unreleased

  * 'configure --with-gtk2' has been replaced by 'configure --with-gtk=version'

    - wavelet equalization
    - saving images in ppm, jpeg, png  format (thanks to GTK2 )

  * This release contains some rewrites of the code base of gtkmorph and
    libmorph.  (not of xmorph, though; I do not use xmorph; I only use
    gtkmorph):
  * some optimizations
  * warp2.c and resample.c  in libmorph:
    1) can warp images of different sizes, (but this is untested)
    2) mesh border does not need to stay on image border,
    3) warp with Lanczos antialiasing  or bilinear resampling
     and added a global setting "antialiasing" to choose bilinear/Lanczos
  * added warp-gtk.h : contains a call to warp GdkPixbufs
  * rewritten code that smooths the meshes: mesh border does not need to
    stay on image border; and added a global setting "preserve border" to
    lock/unlock the border of the meshes
  * removed bashism from debian/rules (closes: 219995)

  * NMU to fix build-failures
  * gtkmorph/Makefile.am: add @GDK_PIXBUF_CFLAGS@ to INCLUDES
  * debian/control:
    - corrected bad Build-Dependency (Closes: #119005)
    - add versioning of 1.1.17 to Build-Dep on debhelper
    - fix up poor grammar and other errors in package descriptions 
          [AM: isn't he such a nice guy?]
    - fix duplicate and missing package relationships (probably caused by
      ignorance of proper dh_shlibdeps usage)
  * debian/docs: don't ship COPYING or INSTALL documents
  * debian/postrm moved to debian/prerm (where install-info should be run)
  * debian/{postinst,prerm,libmorph.postinst}: include #DEBHELPER# tokens
  * debian/rules:
    - removed invocation of dh_testversion
    - use dh_shlibdeps properly for this shared-library-containing package
    - removed useless invocation of dh_suidregister
  * re-ran aclocal; automake; autoconf against modern libgdk-pixbuf-dev so
    this package would know where to find that library's headers
  * package now lintian-clean
