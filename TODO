XMORPH TO DO

I think it would be really cool and very appropriate if I got "before"
and "after" pictures of Michael Jackson and morphed one into the other
as a test.  If anybody has such images, please send them to me.

I have access to a Win95 machine, but not to a Macintosh with a C
compiler, so I can not test tkmorph on a Macintosh.  I would appreciate
if someone helped me out with development on a Mac.

Enhance interpolation routines to handle situations where the mesh
lines are not a true function (i.e. where a single abscissa has more
than one ordinate.)  This should be easy to fix either by
parameterizing the spline or by using line segments for the
interpolant.  There is not really good reason not to use line segments
for interpolants anyway -- they are easier and faster to compute and
their behavior is more predictable than cubic splines.  Line segments
are less smooth but generally there will be so many knots that
smoothing just gets in the way.

Fix the problem where the last vertical line and the last horizontal
line are black after a warp.  This is probably a problem with the
interpolation arrays.

Support a wider range of image file types, including JPEG, PPM, and
TIFF in xmorph.
(gtkmorph reads all formats that gdk-pixbuf libraries support).

If anybody is interested in helping out on these things, please let me
know.

THE NEW PROJECT TODO

The new autoconf/automake building environment
has not been widely tested (yet).

In particular, the X libraries are not well managed:
(ie, it may not work on SGI IRIX).

The GIMP plugin feature is not automatically configurable thru 
"configure" (yet); you may try to tweak in "Makefile.conf".

language translate 

the locale may play strange tricks to people saving and
loading the meshes, if they have 
the LANG environment or some LC_* environment;
it would be important to deactivate such locales
when saving and loading mesh data.

GTKMORPH TODO

implement undo

docs!! docbook  format? html?
