DESCRIPTION: xmorph-gtk is a GUI (=graphical user interface) for the
 morphing engine in xmorph, with some enhancement

DEPENDS: you will need to have the source code of xmorph,
 and the libraries:        glib gdk gdk-pixbuf gtk
 and the includes from these libraries
 (in "Debian GNU/Linux" they are in the '-dev' packages)
 
INSTALL: 
   first, you have to obtain a copy of xmorph, unpack it in the subdirectory
   «xmorph/»,    read the instructions, 
    set it up (by editing the Makefile as desired), and build the library
    "libmorph.a" 
    
   second, you have to build and install this package: issue 
    $ sh ./configure
    $ make
    at the prompt; if this fails, please read the file "INSTALL"

EVENTUALLY: have fun
